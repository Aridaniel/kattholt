# Loppa
### A cat shelter database system for Kattholt.

![Rocking kitty](./src/img/loading.gif)

Loppa is a database made for Kattholt which is a shelter for lost cats in ReykjavÃ­k, Iceland. With this tool they are able to document and keep data about all the cats that come to their shelter. It is a lightweight system made for ease of access and simplicity for the user.

For this project my team used the MERN stack (MongoDb, Express, React, Node.js).
